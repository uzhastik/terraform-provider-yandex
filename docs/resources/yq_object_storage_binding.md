# yandex_yq_object_storage_binding (Resource)

Object Storage binding. For more information, see [the official documentation](https://yandex.cloud/docs/query/concepts/glossary#binding).

## Example usage

```terraform
//
// Create a new Object Storage binding.
//

resource "yandex_yq_object_storage_binding" "my_os_binding" {
    name = "tf-test-os-binding"
    description = "Binding has been created from Terraform"
    connection_id = yandex_yq_object_storage_connection.my_os_connection.id
    format = "csv_with_names"
    path_pattern = "my_logs/"
    format_setting = {
      "file_pattern" = "*.csv"
    }
    column {
      name="year"
      type="Int32"
      not_null = true
   }
    column {
      name="month"
      type="Int32"
      not_null = true
   }
    column {
      name="day"
      type="Int32"
      not_null = true
   }

   partitioned_by = ["year", "month", "day"]
   column {
        name = "ts"
        type = "Timestamp"
    }
    column {
        name = "message"
        type = "Utf8"
    }
}

- `description` (String) The resource description.
- `format_setting` (Map of String) Special format setting.
- `partitioned_by` (List of String) The list of partitioning column names.
- `projection` (Map of String) Projection rules.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--column"></a>
### Nested Schema for `column`
